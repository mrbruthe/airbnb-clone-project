- Learn and apply modern web development practices
- Build a scalable, maintainable codebase

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)
- Authentication: NextAuth
- Deployment: Vercel / Render

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency across pages
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages
| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters for price, location, and rating |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property details with images, description, amenities, and booking form |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.

### Design Properties from Figma

#### Color Styles
- Primary: #34967C
